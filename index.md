## 👋 Hey, I'm Kala

I’m a data enthusiast and a creative writer. COMBINATION (IYKYK).  
After lots of research (and yes, a few personality tests), I found myself drawn to data science and machine learning.

Analyzing patterns and predicting trends? That’s something I’ve always done — from tracking my student finances and habits to observing people and tailoring how I communicate. Even guessing the price of stuff before it goes on sale 🛍️. So why not go deeper and build a career around it?

This portfolio is a small glimpse into my tech journey — a mix of logic, creativity, and curiosity.

If you ever want to chat, collaborate, or want some content magic or data insights... I’m always down for it.
